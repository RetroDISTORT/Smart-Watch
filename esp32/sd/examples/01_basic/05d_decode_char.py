# Fonts is composed of characters stored within a dictionnary. 
# The dictionary key is the ascii code of the caracter (the ordinal value).
# The character himself is encoded as numerical value (one value by colum)
#   all the values (columns) being store into the list
#
# The Following sample will:
#   * Access the caracter definition for "A"
#   * Show the encoded values (list of columns) 
#   * Show the encoded values as list of bits
#       - where you can identity back the caracters 
#       - the characters is encoded with a rotation of 90 degree
#       - the non relevant bit are set to 1 (see the remarks in the code)
#
# The default driver font is Arial 14 (named Arial_14) 
#    Arial 14 has 14 points height!

#
# As you can see, all the value starts with 0b1!
# Why?
# 
# We have coded an Arial 14, so 14 points height.
# The 14 rightmost bits represent this information (the A).
# The remaing bits on the left (the 15th in this case) are
#   not used... so they are to set to 1. This is why all
#   the values starts with the 15th bit at 1.
